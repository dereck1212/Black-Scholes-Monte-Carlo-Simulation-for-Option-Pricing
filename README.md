# Black-Scholes-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Option-Pricing
This project implements the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European Call and Put options. It includes an interactive Jupyter Notebook with a GUI to input parameters, run simulations, and visualize stock price paths and option price convergence with confidence intervals.

Overview
This project implements two methods for pricing European call options:

Black-Scholes Analytical Model: A closed-form solution for option pricing.
Monte Carlo Simulation: A numerical approach to estimate option prices based on simulated stock price paths.
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes an interactive graphical user interface (GUI), built using ipywidgets, allowing users to input parameters and visualize the results.

Features
Black-Scholes Model: Calculates the price of European call options using the analytical Black-Scholes formula.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulates stock price paths and estimates the option price with confidence intervals.
Interactive GUI: Users can input key parameters such as stock price, strike price, volatility, risk-free rate, and more.
Visualizations: Plotly-based visualizations to show stock price paths and the convergence of the Monte Carlo simulation.
Theoretical Background
Black-Scholes Model
The Black-Scholes model provides a closed-form solution to calculate the price of European call options based on:

Stock price (S)
Strike price (K)
Time to maturity (T)
Risk-free interest rate (r)
Volatility (σ)
The option price is given by:

Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation estimates the option price by simulating random stock price paths and calculating the average payoff, discounted back to the present. Confidence intervals for the simulation are provided based on standard error calculations.

Project Structure
black_scholes_call: Calculates the European call option price using the Black-Scholes formula.
monte_carlo_call: Simulates stock price paths using the Monte Carlo method and estimates the option price with confidence intervals.
GUI Interface: Users can interact with widgets to input parameters and run the simulations.
